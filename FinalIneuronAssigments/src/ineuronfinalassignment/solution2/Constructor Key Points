
		   Constructor Key Points :-
		  
		   1) Constructor have same name as class name. 
		   
		   2)Constructor parameter will work like method parameter. 
		   
		   3) It is called when object is created or when object is instantiated. 
		   
		   4) Inside constructor return statement is valid.
		   
		   5) Constructor will not have return type explicitly. 
		   
		   6) Inside Constructor first statement is super() method or this() method. 
		   
		   7) Super() method calls parent class constructor. 
		   
		   8) this() method calls constructor of same class. 
		   
		   9) Inside constructor only one method is allowed super() or this() method. 
		   
		   10) We can't write this() or super() method apart from first statement in constructor body. 
		   
		   11) We can have more than one constructor with different parameters in a class called as constructor overloading.
